learn the following topics:\n\n* How to use Keras models in scikit-learn.\n* How to use grid search in scikit-learn.\n* How to tune batch size and training epochs.\n* How to tune learning rate\n* How to tune network weight initialization.\n* How to tune activation functions.\n* How to tune dropout regularization.\n* How to tune the number of neurons in the hidden layer.\n
